# react-and-a-rest-api-v1

I have implemented both basic project requirements and exceeds expectations. 

To get running: 
- cd into `/api` and run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start REST server
- In a new terminal window cd into `/client` and run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start App


## Exceeds Expectations Features: 
- Display user friendly messages
    - NotFound - Display a message letting the user know that the requested page can't be found.
    - Forbidden - Displays a message letting the user know that they can't access the requested page.
    - UnhandledError - Display a message letting the user know that an unexpected error has occurred.
- Persist user credentials
- Redirecting the user after successfully signing in
